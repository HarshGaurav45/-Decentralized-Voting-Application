# 🗳️ Decentralized Voting Application

Decentralized Voting Application is a blockchain-based platform that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. By leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum network, this app allows voters to securely cast their votes and guarantees that results are immutable and verifiable by anyone. With an easy-to-use interface built using React.js and the power of Web3.js for blockchain interaction, this application is a modern solution for decentralized elections.
